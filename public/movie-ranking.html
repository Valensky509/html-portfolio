<h1>The Best Movies According to Valensky</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3> The Equalizer 1</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite action movies.  The story is perfect. Denzel Washington plays his role to perfection. He's really cool and tough when he's taking on large, structured criminal organizations on his own.

<h3>La Vie Scolaire</h3>
<p>I like this film because it illustrates the lives of some students particularly well.</p>
<h3>The akedown</h3>
<p>The actors are first and foremost great comedians. This film made me laugh. </p>
